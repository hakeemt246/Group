        <h1>More About Us</h1>
        <p>As a mainly web-oriented business, our biggest marketing challenge will be
            getting potential customers who view our real world advertisements to actually
            visit our online website. The use of online guerrilla marketing is the
            main strategy we will implement to overcome this challenge. QR Codes, email blast,
            social media ads and other such promotions all play a vital role in overcoming such
            a challenge as they provide direct linkage to the site that is user friendly.
            This strategy will prove to be efficient in generating online traffic to the
            website as it is generally inexpensive in comparison to traditional marketing such
            as newspapers and billboards. Guerrilla marketing will keep our firms in potential
            customers thoughts often and as our main product is cakes this will prove beneficial
            as the average household buys as least two cakes each year for special occasions.Dream
            Cakes will take a cost-based pricing approach which allows us to dictate an easily justifiable
            price as costs are easy to calculate. In efforts to keep pricing as reasonable as possible,
            we have also chosen to directly distribute to our customer through delivery. To reduce expenses
            Dream Cakes will produce all goods from someoneâ€™s home.
